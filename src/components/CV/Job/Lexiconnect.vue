        My day to day activities were an overlap of several roles, from the backend engineer, to the product manager, to the project manager.

          I managed VPS and dedicated servers for our clients, an experience that gave me insight in the LAMP and LEMP stacks, and on how to manage *NIX environments.
          I built integrations with several APIs, such as TrustPilot and Microsoft Bing, that showed me how great APIs are structured.
          The biggest project I worked on was a Python service that would serve the original applicationsâ€™ contents in different languages.
